I am an Associate Professor of Marketing at the [Lee Kong Chian School of Business](https://business.smu.edu.sg/), Singapore Management University. I serve as Chair of the Institutional Review Board and Senate Chair. I was previously Director of PhD Programmes at LKCSB (2020–2023).

My research focuses on consumer behavior, consumer judgment and decision-making, affect (feelings and moods), consumer experiences, and innovation/entrepreneurship. My work has been published in leading journals including the *Journal of Consumer Research*, *Journal of Marketing Research*, and *Psychological Science*.

I received my Ph.D. and M.Phil. in Marketing from Columbia University, and my B.A. in Economics from the University of California.
