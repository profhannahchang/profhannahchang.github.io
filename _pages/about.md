I am an Associate Professor of Marketing at the [Lee Kong Chian School of Business](https://business.smu.edu.sg/) (LKCSB), [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/) (SMU). At SMU, I serve as Faculty Senate Chair and IRB Chair. I was previously Director of PhD Programmes at LKCSB (2020–2023).

My research focuses on consumer behavior and decision making, affect, consumer experience, and technology-mediated marketplaces (e.g., crowdfunding, crowdsourcing, AI/LLMs, and voice technology). My work has appeared in leading journals including the *Journal of Consumer Research*, *Journal of Marketing Research*, and *Psychological Science*. I serve as Area Editor at the *International Journal of Research in Marketing* and Associate Editor (Research Articles) at the *Journal of Consumer Psychology*. I received my Ph.D. and M.Phil. in Marketing from Columbia University and my B.A. (*Summa Cum Laude*) in Economics from UC Irvine.
