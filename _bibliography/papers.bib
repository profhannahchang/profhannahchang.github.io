  abstract  = {This case study uses Spotify's AI DJ to examine the ``personalization paradox,'' where product features designed to deepen user connection can instead cause alienation. An analysis of over 1,400 user comments identifies three core frictions: a perceived loss of user agency, mismanaged expectations for the human-like AI, and a scalability bottleneck that led to repetitive content. Students are placed in the role of a product manager tasked with developing a prioritized roadmap to address these issues, forcing them to grapple with the critical trade-offs between technological capability and user psychology.},

  abstract  = {The case is set in 2021, amid accelerating digitalisation in Singapore, as Marriott International is facing pressure to innovate and review the AI strategy for its hotel brands. Marriott is the second largest hospitality player in terms of market share in Singapore, with AccorHotels Group holding market leadership. In 2016, Marriott merged with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, valued at US$12.2 billion, making it the largest hotel chain in the world. Before the merger, Starwood had established itself as a technical innovation leader in the hospitality industry, which aligns with Marriott's goals to improve the guest experience and build loyalty using technology. For example, Starwood invested in an array of services such as a mobile app which guests can bypass check-ins and use their mobile devices for keyless entry. Marriott has also channelled efforts toward digitalisation and innovation, and is one of the pioneers in deploying guest-facing technologies such as keyless entries and smart rooms. The company had partnered with Alibaba Group in a joint venture to pilot test a facial recognition check-in system with Fliggy, Alibaba's travel service platform. This seamless and convenient alternative sought to meet the needs of tech-savvy Chinese travellers, who are receptive to technology powered by facial recognition.},

  abstract  = {The case is set in January 2019, when Di Xu, the team leader of Ant Forest, a green initiative within the Chinese payment and lifestyle app Alipay, is reviewing the strategy for Ant Forest. Ant Forest was started in 2016 as a corporate social responsibility (CSR) project under Alipay, financially supported by Alipay's parent company, Ant Financial. From the time of its launch to October 2018, Ant Forest has managed to attract almost 400 million users to its cause of promoting low carbon emissions behaviour among its users. It has done so by letting users win ``energy points'' through low-carbon behaviours (such as walking to work instead of driving, or reducing their use of plastic), and then accumulating the points towards planting a virtual tree of their choice. When a user had accumulated a sufficient number of energy points, Ant Forest would, through its partners, plant a real, physical tree on their behalf in the deserts of Inner Mongolia. The uptake of the Ant Forest initiative has exceeded the team's expectations, and there has been considerable positive feedback received from users who have experienced good social and health benefits. Di Xu is now evaluating the next steps for Ant Forest. Should the Ant Forest initiative be taken overseas? If so, which features of the product, and the business model, should be implemented?},

Describing the brand evolution over its first eight years of existence, the case allows for an exploration of the challenges associated with creating a luxury brand and reconciling several strategic imperatives: the need to build a strong and desirable brand identity, grow the business but also protect brand integrity and exclusivity. The case also provides an opportunity to discuss the benefits and challenges associated with being a luxury brand ``made in China'' and a category specialist.},

  abstract  = {The case is set in 2014, from the perspective of Pyra, a Singaporean subscription box company for beauty products. A more recent variant of subscription-box services personalizes the selection of products delivered, by closely matching products with customers' preferences. Pyra falls squarely in this category, relying on data analytics and proprietary algorithms to personalise its selection of products. Pyra was launched in early 2013 and has had reasonable success in its first year of operations, with double-digit month-on-month growth in customer base. However, there are nagging doubts about whether the business will continue to be viable in the longer term. Customer retention might prove to be a challenge, as customers' interest in accessing novel products could wane with time. In addition, with the entry of direct competition becoming an imminent event, there are looming questions about the sustainability of Pyra's competitive advantage. The case provides students an opportunity to analyze the long-term viability of the business model in its current form and recommend what Pyra should do to develop a sustainable competitive advantage.},
